# Unity-Project-Zero
DAT Unity Course Final Project

# Multiplayer-Development
A project exploring the photon network combined with the Playfab account system.

## Exam Proposal
This project is a solo project, as it takes interest in my future internship. My project will have a
high focus on multiplayer technologies, as online multiplayer games have shown to hold players
interest, by enabling them to socialize and compete. The project will be using the Photon 2
Network and the Playfab Azure service. The project is a combined effort of 2 electives:
Advanced Programming & Introduction to Unity.
Project Overview:
● Creating the system to access the Photon 2 Network.
● Creating the system to create users profiles and handle game data with playfab.
● Design the software using the principles taught in advanced programming.
● Create a game designed around the cloud system and its technologies.
● Using game design principles to develop fun gameplay.
The scope of the project may vary, as the requirements for the project will be discovered
throughout the project, and as time permits.

## The Completed Project

A full functional multiplayer game with cloud synced accounts and player interaction.
